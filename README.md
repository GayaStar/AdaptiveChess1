this is a reinforcement+stockfish chess website (under progress)

Frontend Module Descriptions (public/js/)

main.js:
Entry point for the app. Initializes the chessboard, fetches session/user data, and sets up UI interactions including voice input. Instantiates Stockfish via Web Workers.

state.js:
Manages global application state (board, game object, rating, session info). Provides accessor methods for use across modules.

board.js:
Initializes the interactive chessboard (via Chessboard.js), handles click-based move input, highlights valid and recent moves, and manages pawn promotion UI.

game.js:
Controls overall gameplay flow: starting/resetting games, undoing moves, switching player colors, and saving game data to the backend.

stockfish.js:
Runs the Stockfish engine as a Web Worker, receives engine responses, and adjusts difficulty based on user performance (depth control). Coordinates AI move execution.

analysis.js:
Evaluates each player move using Stockfishâ€™s centipawn loss and best move prediction. Labels user moves as "Good", "Inaccuracy", "Mistake", or "Blunder". Displays feedback in a categorized format.

utils.js:
Converts move notation between SAN and UCI formats. Includes helper functions like ELO score calculation and basic transformation logic for analysis and training.

ui.js:
Updates dynamic UI elements â€” move list, player ratings, game status, and final result. Triggers visual game-end states and manages adaptive feedback messages.

ui-events.js:
Binds UI buttons like New Game, Undo, Analyze, and Play as White/Black to corresponding logic. Also hooks into analysis and voice recognition toggles.
